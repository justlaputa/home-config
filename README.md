# What is this?
  These are my linux home configuration files, I also use them in cygwin under windows,
  and mac OSX, nothing particular.
  
# How to clone

  I need to place these files under my home directory, so I don't use _git clone_:
  
    cd ~
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:justlaputa/home-config.git
    git fetch origin
    git checkout -t origin/master
